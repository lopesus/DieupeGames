    jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
    ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity
    or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability
    thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the
    remaining provisions of the terms, which shall continue to be in full
    force and effect.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    The failure of DieupeGames to require or enforce strict performance by
    you of any provision of these Terms of Service or the DieupeGames Privacy
    Policy or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be
    construed as a waiver or relinquishment of DieupeGames's right to assert
    or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other
    instance.
</p>
<p>
    The express waiver by DieupeGames of any provision, condition, or
    requirement of these Terms of Service or the DieupeGames Privacy Policy
    shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with
    such provision, condition or requirement.
</p>
<p>
    Except as expressly and specifically set forth in this these Terms
    of Service, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or

    DieupeGames.

    entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the
    obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the
    event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you.
</p>
